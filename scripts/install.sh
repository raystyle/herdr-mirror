# Link the CLI at the stable path the README documents. Keybindings must use
# the absolute ~/.local/bin/herdr-mirror (herdr runs shell bindings through a
# login sh that never reads ~/.zshrc, so PATH can't be trusted there), and
# `herdr-mirror <cmd>` should work from a shell. Refreshed on every update;
# a live file or link we don't manage is left alone.
#
# The link must NOT target pwd: herdr runs this build in
# <plugins>/.tmp-install-*/checkout and only afterwards renames the checkout
# to <plugins>/github/<id>-<hash>, deleting the temp dir — a link to pwd
# dangles the moment the install succeeds. Derive that final path instead
# (<hash> = first 12 hex chars of sha256(<id>), herdr's managed-path scheme;
# the link briefly dangles until herdr's rename lands, which is fine). Run by
# hand in a dev checkout (no .tmp-* ancestor under a plugins dir) it links
# the checkout itself. `herdr-mirror status` reports link health, and the
# daemon toasts if it ever goes stale, so a future herdr layout change is
# loud, not a silent dead key.
